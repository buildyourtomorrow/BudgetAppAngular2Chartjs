					You got it!  Also, purchasing lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions may also be considered cash advances. Making a payment using third-party services may also be considered a cash advance. Many people are surprised to learn that purchasing lottery tickets on a credit card is the same as making a cash advance. The main reason is that compulsive gamblers could accumulate unmanageable debt. Therefore, due to the increased risk, banks charge higher rates to protect themselves.
